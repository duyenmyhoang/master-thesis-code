# Motivating Sustainable Mobility Behavior with Informational Digital Nudging

## Exploring Alternative Transport Modes in the Netherlands

### About the Research
The **BMW 360° Mobility App** was developed to experiment with innovative mobility services while allowing users to influence the future of mobility through their feedback. One of the app's key features, **My Travels Alternatives**, personalizes travel insights and provides users with a more comfortable experience while monitoring their mobility behavior. 

This research investigates how the **My Travels Alternatives** feature impacts user driving behavior, particularly its role in promoting sustainable mobility choices.
